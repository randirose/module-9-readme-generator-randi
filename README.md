# README Generator - Module 9 Challenge

## Description

The goal with this assignment is to use Node, Inquirer and fs to be able to dynamically generate a professional README.md file for use on any project. This application can be used to generate a README with all the necessary components for any project or application.  
  
This project not only provides a way to generate a README file from the user's command line, it also serves as great practice for using node.js and the inquirer and fs libraries. I learned a lot about all of these technologies, as well as using dynamic values within template literals to be able to easily generate stylized text.

## Table of Contents

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Features](#features)

## Installation

In order to run this application, you will need to install node on your computer, and then use 'npm install' to install inquirer v8.2.4.

## Usage

To use this application to render a professional README file, follow these steps below:  
  
- Make sure all necessary libraries are installed per the Installation section above  
- Run the command 'node index.js' in your terminal  
- Answer the following questions  
- Select your license from the list when that question is populated  
- Submit your answers! You will see the answers logged in the terminal once you've submitted them, and you should see "success!" if there were no errors thrown  
- If there are any answers you'd like to change, simply restart the process and it will overwrite your README file  
- View your newly generated README file, titled new-README.md  
- Edit or add any sections you may need, and rename the file if desired.
